Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 47 of /Users/david/Documents/test7/ML_HRD_project2/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
output/plot_2.jpg
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job plot_ROCs since they might be corrupted:
output/plot_1.jpg, output/plot_3.jpg, output/plot_4.jpg, output/table_1.jpg, output/table_2.jpg
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
